# StreetSmart API (Coming Soon)

Public documentation for the **StreetSmart API**.

The StreetSmart API provides structured access to aggregated public housing data, helping developers build tools that surface tenant rights, rent stabilization status, building violations, and property conditions.

StreetSmart aggregates data from public records and trusted sources to deliver insights on:
- rent stabilization and regulatory status
- housing code violations
- building conditions and incident history (e.g. bedbugs, floods, water issues)
- noise and quality-of-life complaints
- tenant-submitted reviews and reports

The API is designed for:
- tenant advocacy tools
- proptech platforms
- legal and compliance software
- housing research and analysis

## Status

The StreetSmart API is currently in development. This repository will contain:
- API reference documentation
- authentication and usage guides
- example requests and responses
- OpenAPI / schema definitions
